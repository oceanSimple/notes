The bar charts above shows the situation about the mobile-phone subscriptions in developed and developing countries from 2000 to 2008. As it exhabited, the accounts of subscriptions soared remarkably in developed countries, compared with a little rise in developing countries.

There exists plenty of cause accounting for this phenomenor in various respects. Firstly, the government in developing countries may focus on infrastructure construction, rather than introducing policies to promote mobile-phone subscriptions in developed countries. Then the subscription service probably didn't provide adequate convenience to the people in developing countries, which made them lack of interest in subscriptions. Above all, the low income and life pressure would make them have no spare money to afford mobile-phone subscriptions.

In my opinions, if the country and enterprise want to enhance the mobile-phone subscriptions, the most essential way is to improve the life quantity income of their citzens.

*The bar charts above illustrate the trends in mobile phone subscriptions in developed and developing countries from 2000 to 2008.* *As shown, the number of subscriptions surged significantly from 0.5 billion to 4 billion in developed countries, while developing countries experienced only a modest increase frome 0.7 billion to 1 billion.*

*Several factors contribute to this phenomenon*. *Firstly, governments in developing countries often prioritize infrastructure development over policies that promote mobile phone subscriptions.* Additionally, subscription services in these countries may not offer sufficient convenience, resulting in a lack of interest among the population. Furthermore, low income and financial pressures often leave individuals with little *disposable income* for mobile phone subscriptions.

In my opinion, if governments and businesses aim to boost mobile phone subscriptions, the most crucial step is to improve the income and quality of life for their citizens.

As is demonstrated in the diagram, from 2000 to 2008, the mobile-phone subscription number grew sharply from 0.5 billion to 4 billion in developing countries. Contrastingly, during the same period, there was only a moderate increase (frome 0.7 billion to 1 billion) in developed countries.

*Different performance was due to different market environment.* In developing countries, the mobile phone market hadn’t reached saturation. Consider ring the population size there, the number of potential customers would be enormous. Thanks to the economic boom, an increasing number of potential customers gradually joined the market, resulting in the *take-off* of mobile phone subscriptions. However, in developed countries, there was a saturated market, leaving little room for growth.

Since the mobile phone market remains vast and the economy is still growing steadily in developing countries, the number of mobile phone subscribers there will continue to grow at a fast rate; nevertheless, the growth will slow down as the market reaches saturation. In comparison, the market has reached saturation in developed countries, so the growth of mobile phone subscription number is expected to remain stagnant unless extra demand in stimulated.

The bar chart above illustrate the percentage of partly different taxi brand accounting for the domestic taxi market in 2008 and 2009. As shown, Japanese brand account for the most among the Chinese brand and American brand in 2008, while China brand’ account surpass the Japanese brand in 2009. American brand always in the last place.

Japan had a rapid economic recovery after world war 2 and inherited the previous industrial technology, which made it have a big lead in the area of car manufacturing. So Japanese brand accounted for over one to three market shares before 2008. And Thanks to the economic take-off and car industry development after the reform and opening up, Chinese brand’s taxi market shares was able to surpass Japanese brand in 2009.

I always believe that China will have a further promising future in various market area including taxi market. And as the Chinese technology develop, Chinese brand may account for over half at the taxi market.

The bar chart above illustrates the percentage of various taxi brands in the domestic taxi market for 2008 and 2009. It shows that in 2008, Japanese brands held the largest share among Chinese and American brands. However, in 2009, Chinese brands surpassed Japanese brands in market share, while American brands consistently occupied the last position.

Japan experienced a rapid economic recovery after World War II, benefiting from inherited industrial technology, which gave it a significant advantage in car manufacturing. As a result, Japanese brands accounted for more than one-third of the market share before 2008. Conversely, due to economic growth and advancements in the car industry following China's reform and opening up, Chinese brands were able to surpass Japanese brands in the taxi market by 2009.

I believe that China has a promising future in various market sectors, including the taxi market. As Chinese technology continues to develop, Chinese brands may capture over half of the taxi market share.
